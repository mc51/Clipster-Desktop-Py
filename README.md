## Easy Setup

### Linux 

Copy and paste the following in bash to clone the git repo and start the `install.sh` script:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/mc51/Clipster-Desktop.git && cd Clipster-Desktop && sh install.sh
```

The install script takes care of everything.  

### Windows

Download [`clipster.exe`](https://github.com/mc51/Clipster-Desktop/releases/latest/download/clipster.exe) from the latest Windows release and start it. To automatically start Clipster, open the current user's autostart folder by opening Explorer and typing `shell:startup`. Copy `clipster.exe` there. 

### MacOS

Download [`clipster.zip`](https://github.com/mc51/Clipster-Desktop/releases/latest/download/clipster.zip) from the latest MacOS release, move it to `Applications` and start it. You might get a warning message, that you need to ignore. Newer MacOS versions might even prevent you from opening it entirely at first. You have two options:  
1. Open it in the [Finder via `right click --> open`](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac)
2. After failing to open it, go to `System Preferences --> Security & Privacy`. In the `General` Tab the App will be listed and you can start it from there
  
To automatically start Clipster, right click on the icon in your Dock and click on `Options --> Open at Login`.  
    
Now, you can [use](#usage) clipster!  

## Manual Setup

If you absolutely need to, you can install manually.

### Linux 

First, clone the repo:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/mc51/Clipster-Desktop.git && cd Clipster-Desktop
```
  
Second, install the python package:

``` bash
pip install .
```

Now, the `clipster` command will be available in the command line. Clipster depends on the `xsel` or `xclip` packages. On some distributions, you will to need manually install them. On Debian/Ubuntu do:

```bash
sudo apt-get install xsel
```

For a convenient experience, you should run clipster as a background service. For this, you need to setup a `systemd` service. First, find the absolute path to your installation:

```bash
whereis clipster
```

Following, create the file (as root) `/etc/systemd/system/clipster.service` with the following content:

```
[Unit]
Description=Clipster - A Multi Platform Cloud Clipboard Clipboard
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/tmp
ExecStart=<PATH>
ExecReload=/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID
ExecStop=/bin/kill -s TERM $MAINPID
Restart=always
RestartSec=1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Change \<PATH\> to your installation path. Now, run the following to reload the configuration, enable auto start, and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable clipster
sudo systemctl start clipster
```

Finally, check the status with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status clipster
```

If all went fine, you should see:

``` bash
‚óè clipster.service - Clipster - A Multi Platform Cloud Clipboard
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/clipster.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Mon 2020-08-01 12:00:0 CEST; 30min ago
```

Now, you can [use](#usage) clipster!

## Usage

On the first startup, you can either register a new account or enter your existing credentials for the login. Your credentials will be stored in your `HOMEPATH` in `./config/clipster/config`.  
Clipster will add an Icon to your system tray which you can click for opening up a menu.  
`Get Clip` will fetch the clipboard content from the server.  
`Set Clip` will send your current clipboard to the server. Then, it's available for all your devices.  
`Edit Credentials` allows you to register a new account or change your login credentials.  
`Exit` will terminate the app.  

## Planned features
